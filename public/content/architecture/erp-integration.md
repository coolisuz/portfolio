# Automotive ERP Integration Layer

## System Overview

A comprehensive integration layer connecting an automotive dealership ERP with 8+ external systems including payment processors, government registries, and financing partners, handling €5M+ annual transactions.

## Architecture Components

### Integration Hub

Central orchestration layer managing all external API communications:
- API gateway for unified access
- Request/response transformation
- Protocol translation (REST, SOAP, XML-RPC)
- Error handling and retry logic

### External Integrations

1. **Payment Processors**
   - Card payment gateways
   - Bank transfers
   - Installment financing

2. **Government Systems**
   - Vehicle registration API
   - Tax calculation services
   - Import/export documentation

3. **Financing Partners**
   - Credit scoring
   - Loan approval workflows
   - Insurance providers

4. **Inventory Management**
   - Supplier APIs
   - Parts catalogs
   - Warehouse management

### Authentication & Security

- **OAuth2 + Azure AD** for enterprise SSO
- **API key rotation** for external services
- **Encrypted data at rest and in transit**
- **Audit logging** for compliance

## Workflow Automation

### Invoice Generation Pipeline

```javascript
async function generateInvoice(sale) {
  // 1. Calculate taxes via government API
  const taxes = await taxService.calculate(sale);

  // 2. Process payment
  const payment = await paymentGateway.charge(sale.total + taxes);

  // 3. Register vehicle
  await vehicleRegistry.register(sale.vehicle);

  // 4. Generate invoice with 99.9% accuracy
  return await invoiceService.create({
    sale,
    taxes,
    payment
  });
}
```

### Kanban Workflow System

Custom workflow engine for tracking 20+ team members:
- Visual task boards
- Automated status updates
- SLA monitoring
- Bottleneck detection

## Data Flow

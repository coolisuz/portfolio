# Stock Trading Platform Architecture

## System Overview

A highly scalable microservices architecture designed to handle real-time stock trading for 150K+ concurrent users with sub-100ms latency and 99.9% uptime.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services

1. **Order Service**
   - Handles order placement, modification, and cancellation
   - Publishes events to Kafka for async processing
   - PostgreSQL for transactional integrity

2. **Market Data Service**
   - Real-time price updates
   - Redis caching for sub-millisecond reads
   - WebSocket connections for client updates

3. **Settlement Service**
   - Post-trade processing
   - Account balance updates
   - Transaction reconciliation

4. **User Management Service**
   - Authentication & authorization
   - KYC/AML compliance
   - Portfolio management

### Infrastructure

- **Event Bus:** Apache Kafka for inter-service communication
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache:** Redis cluster for session and market data
- **Container Orchestration:** AWS ECS with auto-scaling
- **Load Balancer:** Application Load Balancer with health checks

## Key Design Patterns

### Event Sourcing
All state changes captured as immutable events, providing complete audit trail and ability to replay transactions.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate read and write models for optimal performance:
- Write: Optimized for consistency and durability
- Read: Optimized for speed with denormalized views

### Circuit Breaker
Prevents cascade failures when downstream services are unavailable.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput:** 10,000+ orders/second
- **Latency:** <100ms p99
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Data Consistency:** ACID compliance for financial transactions
